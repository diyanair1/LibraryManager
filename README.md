# Personal Library Management System

A application to manage a book collection. This project combines core data structures and algorithms to enable efficient operations like adding, removing, searching, and sorting books.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

**In Progress**: This project is currently under development. Below are the planned features and data structures that will be implemented.

---
## Current Features:

- **Add/Remove Books** â€“ Maintain your personal library
- **Search Books** â€“ Lookup by title or ISBN (partial or full)
- **List Books** â€“ View all books with sorting options
<!-- - **Undo/Redo** â€“ Reverse your recent actions -->
<!-- - **Categorization** â€“ Group books by genre -->
<!-- - **Save/Load Collection** â€“ Persist your data via file I/O -->

## ðŸ“¦ Data Structures (In Development)

| Structure         | Purpose                                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Arrays/Vectors** | Store the book collection                      |
| **Linked List**    | Dynamic list (manual implementation if no STL) |
| **Stack / Queue**  | Undo/Redo functionality, command history       |
| **Hash Table (Map)** | Fast search by ISBN, title, genre             |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Sorted views (e.g., by author/title)     |
| **Priority Queue / Heap** | Sort or rank books by rating               |

## ðŸ¤– Roadmap

### Working on these Features:
- Search by partial title
- Categorize by genre using hash map
- Sort by author, year, rating

### Planned Features
- Command history (queue-based)
- Book ratings (priority queue / heapsort)
- Hash-indexed file access via BookID
- Integrate machine learning for book recommendations
